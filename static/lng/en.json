    "tb_p":"Tuberculosis is a deadly infectious disease that commonly infects the lungs. Caused by the bacteria <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, tuberculosis can be spread and transmitted through the air when a person infected with tuberculosis coughs, sneezes, or spits. The tuberculosis bacteria can cause respiratory problems, such as chronic cough accompanied by phlegm and even blood spots, and shortness of breath. If untreated, the tuberculosis infection can spread throughout the lungs and cause permanent damage to the lung tissue which can lead to complications such as pneumonia, lung abscess, and death.",
